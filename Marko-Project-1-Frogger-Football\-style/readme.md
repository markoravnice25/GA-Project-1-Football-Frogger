# Project 1: World Cup Croatia vs England

World Cup Croatia vs England is based on the Frogger game. The objective is to use Croatian and Chelsea player Mateo Kovacic using the arrow keys to score in England's goal. England players can be changed according to image, but Harry Macguire gets the nod at the moment, with Pickford in goals.

## **Technologies used**

## **HTML**
* 2 main screens - an overlay and a main game screen.

## **CSS**
* flex-box used to position majority of elements on page.

## **JavaScript**
* keyDown to move characters.
* localStorage to set high score.
* 3 levels of play

## **Key learnings**
* Flex-box
* using Div's as containers for easier CSS
* localStorage to set high score
* setInterval
* creating screen overlay

## **Challenges**
* CSS - how to have images taken from the internet aligned when they have different properties
* The timer - when something is in the same div container it makes micro-movements as the timer's digits change.

## **Future improvements**
* Refactor code and comment CSS and HTML for future reference (as done in Javascript)
* more regualar git add/commit/push to git hub with clear comments.
* have all English players with their own character.
* Allow for 2 players - Where an English player attacks the Croatian defence.
* function to pick which footballer you want to dribble with.
* time-limit for player dribbling to make it more difficult and prevent dribbling around the sides.
* change window alerts to a div with better styling.
* BETTER USE OF CSS and STYLING in General.

## **Bugs**
* no obvious bugs
